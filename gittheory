Git is used to track of our project code, who is doing what changes.

1. First of all we have to make a setup of a git 
        git config --global user.name "name"
        git config --global user.email "email"

2. To check name and email exist or not we have to check
        git config --global user.name
        git config --global user.email

3. To make changes in config file
        git config --edit
        once saved changes, to exit .....esc :wq

4.  To make folder with the help of command
        mkdir  is command

5. to move into that folder command is 
        cd folder-name

6. Then we have to initialize the git folder to make available on git
        git init   

7. After adding code to file we add to git, git add move code to staging area
        git add . or git add file_name

8. Then here after these we have to commit the code
        git commit -m "commnit Message"

9. After these with the help of git log we can check commit id and modify as per requirements.
        git log

10. In log we can check our commit id, with the help of commit id we can checkout there directly.
        git checkout "commit id"

11. TO create new branch from master 
        git checkout -b dev   <!-- To create new branch and directly checkout on that branch -->

12. Now we will create new branch from dev
        git checkout -b nilesh/taskname
