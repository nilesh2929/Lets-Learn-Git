Git is used to track of our project code, who is doing what changes.

1. First of all we have to make a setup of a git 
        git config --global user.name "name"
        git config --global user.email "email"

2. To check name and email exist or not we have to check
        git config --global user.name
        git config --global user.email

3. To make changes in config file
        git config --edit
        once saved changes, to exit .....esc :wq

4.  To make folder with the help of command
        mkdir  is command

5. to move into that folder command is 
        cd folder-name

6. Then we have to initialize the git folder to make available on git
        git init   

7. After adding code to file we add to git, git add move code to staging area
        git add .
